## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- Media Querry


### What I learned
I learnt hoow to work wwith visibility properties of elements when hovered/not hovered.
I also learnt how to make little animation effects usimg transtions.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


```css
.view-hover {
    transition: .5s ease;
    opacity: 0;
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
    -ms-transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
    text-align: center;
  }
  
```






### Continued development

I would like to foocus more on animations i ythe future as well as more responisive coding.

### Useful resources

- [w3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_overlay.asp) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
